# Human Resources Dashboard with Power BI

For this project, the dataset user for the creation of the dashboard was human resources related, employments, layoffs, turnover percentage, analysis based on the employees and their areas, and much more. Some DAX queries were needed to gather more precise data, in particular the use of CALCULATE with conditionals using COUNTROWS or COUNT in some cases.

Another great addition to the dashboard whichâ€”of course, is entirely dynamic, was the creation of customized tooltips for indicators, a great way of improving the return of relevant data just by highlighting aspects of the dash. The background was made entirely in PowerPoint.
